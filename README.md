# face-recognition-drone-dlib

Recognizes people from video using [dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. This is revised model of [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) which works on live video or live stream from drone. [Dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s accuracy is much more than openCV recognition models.
